# cat shelter project

We are developing an innovative mobile application aimed at helping little toe bean cats find their forever homes. This app will serve as a platform where potential adopters can discover adorable cats in need of loving families. To make the adoption process even more efficient, we will integrate AI technology to assist in locating cats, ensuring that every cat is given the best chance to find a suitable home.
